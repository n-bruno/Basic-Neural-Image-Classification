# Basic Neural Image Classification

## About
This Python project demonstrates basic machine learning with 3-layered neural image classification. I followed [Tech with Tim's tutorial](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-neural-networks/what-is-a-nn/), but took a few liberties here are there.

## Requirements
None. The Python code accesses the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) through the (Keras API)[https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras], the exact details are located on the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification).
